This repo hosts a simple web based simple Signup form. The form takes a few inputs from user and style the form according to the state of the input. It also perform few client-side validation, but the form is never submitted to any API.

This project helps me to further practise what I have learnt in CSS, HTML and to learn new concepts and methods such as form design, styling and validation.
